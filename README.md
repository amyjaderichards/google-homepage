# Summary
First project from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). "For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned."

# Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS

# ToDo -
- Add the magnifying glass and microphone icon and create Google Results page
